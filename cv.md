### Code example:

**Count characters in your string:**
_The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like "aba", then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.
What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.._

```javascript
function count(string) {
    return string.split("").reduce((obj, prop) => {
        obj[prop] = (obj[prop] || 0) + 1;
        return obj;
    }, {});
}
```
